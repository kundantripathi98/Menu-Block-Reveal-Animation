A modern fullscreen menu reveal interaction inspired by high-end agency websites.
This project recreates a block-based grid reveal animation using HTML, CSS, and GSAP, where a staggered sequence of squares animates in/out to reveal a fullscreen menu.

🧠 How It Works

A grid of square divs is generated dynamically depending on the screen size.

On clicking the menu button:

Squares animate in with a random stagger (GSAP).

Then fade out to reveal the fullscreen menu.

Menu visibility is toggled automatically with GSAP opacity/z-index control.

▶️ Running the Project

Just open index.html in your browser.
No build tools. No frameworks. Pure GSAP magic.
